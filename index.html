        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
            <strong><em>technical sophistication</em></strong>, the seemingly magical ability to take
            command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
            everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
            Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
            We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
            learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
            movement, sign up for our <a href="http://learnenough.com/email">official email list</a> now.

            HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a>.
            It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

        <p>

            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
            <a href="http://railstutorial.org/">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
            <a href="http://www.softcover.io/">Softcover publishing platform</a>.
            This page is part of the sample site for
            <a href="http://learnenough.com/html-tutorial"><em>Learn Enough HTML to
            Be Dangerous</em></a>, which teaches the basics of

        <h2>Founders</h2>

        <p>
            Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
            Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
            sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
            <strong>at least a billion people</strong>, and probably more.

        <p>
            Micheal is the creator ofthe <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">
            Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and principal author of the <a href="http://learnenough.com">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence.
            He is an advanced student of <a href="https://kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
            plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillian are slightly exagerated.

        <p>
            When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
            interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

        <p>
            You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy Kimmel, Conan or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
            at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
